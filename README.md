# Disease-Prediction-Machine<br>
<br>
* This model predicts several types of diseases, including Alzheimer's, Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's.<br>
* Initially, the raw data is provided by the organization.<br>
* The model is trained on this dataset, and the user must supply accurate test result values to receive a prediction of disease occurrence.<br>
* Modules such as "numpy", "pandas", and "sklearn" are utilized to develop the prediction model.<br>
<br>
* The following modules, along with their specified versions, are used to run the prediction module:<br>
<pre>
      numpy - 1.26.4<br>
      pandas - 2.2.3<br>
      pickle - 0.7.5<br>
      sklearn - 1.6.1<br>
      streamlit - 1.37.1<br>
      streamlit_option_menu - 0.4.0<br>
</pre>
<br>
* The "web.py" file serves as the main script to run the prediction module.<br>
* The outputs from the trained models are stored in the "MODELS" folder.<br>
* Data feeding is managed by the files located in the "MODULES" folder.<br>
